	"mainText": "The sky is red, I don't understand, past midnight I still see the land. People are sayin' the woman is damned, she makes you burn with a wave of her hand. The city's a blaze, the town's on fire.The woman's flames are reaching higher. We were fools, we called her liar. All I hear is Burn!",
	"secondText": "I didn't believe she was devil's sperm. She said, Curse you all, you'll never learn!When I leave there's no return.The people laughed till she said, Burn! Warning came, no one cared. Earth was shakin', we stood and stared. When it came no one was spared. Still I hear Burn!"
